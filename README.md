## Description
The motivation to complete this project is to become familiar with semantic tags.\
The purpose of the project is to be able to make changes to existing code that will not effect the functionality.\
While working on this project I also learned about new semantic tags and their functions/purpose.

The changes made helped with:
> Adhering to accessibilty standards.\
>Optimization for search engines.\
>The usage of semantic elements.\
>Elements following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.\
>Updating the title element to a concise, descriptive title.\
I learned more about the semantic tags I had already come into contact with.\
